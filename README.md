This is the final Part of WEDE5020 POE Part 3 
Aimed at adding adding corrections from Part 2 and add JAVA Script and SEO to enhance web app functionality 

As outlined project objective in Part 1 of the POE. I have completed a modern website style using html, css and javascript. The website has captured the objective with additional features to enhance user experience and intraction with the information.

Added new css animations designs when hovering over the tabs of services offered 
Created an intractive display of sample email compaign designs images. 
Added Java Script for the website responsivenes to different screen display size with a hidden sidebar. 
I also changed the design of the pages for design uniformity and applying modern website design estatics 

These are the key features added as the completion of POE Part 3. However, there is still room to add more features and optimazition for this website to be fully function and begin deployed.
